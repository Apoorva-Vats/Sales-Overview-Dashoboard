Steps Undertaken
Requirement Gathering: Collaborated with stakeholders to define key metrics and ensure the dashboard meets business needs for YoY comparisons.
Data Walkthrough: Assessed the dataset to understand structure and determine necessary transformations.
Data Cleaning: Removed inconsistencies, duplicates, and ensured proper formatting of numerical data.
Data Modeling: Established relationships and optimized reporting using a star schema.
DAX Calculations: Built measures for CY Sales, PY Sales, YoY Growth, and monthly averages.
Dashboard Design: Created a user-friendly layout with filters for year and metric selection, and visual components such as Bubble Map, Bar Chart, and Bar Sparklines.
Key Features:
Dynamic Filters: Toggle between years and metrics (Sales, Profit, Quantity).
Comparative Analysis: Displays CY, PY, and YoY growth for key metrics.
Visual Insights:
Bubble Map: Sales distribution by state.
Sparklines: Monthly trends with averages for quick insights.
